# Wink Java SDK

Welcome to the Java SDK that enables you to communicate with all that the Wink platform has to offer.

## Getting started
This SDK contains libraries you can leverage to communicate with the Wink platform.

### Java Requirements
Maven artifacts were compiled with Java 17. Java 1.8 is the lowest supported version.

Spring is not required but we highly recommend you use. Our examples will be based on how to do it the "Spring way".
